    spectral_density(fluxes, merger_rate_per_sec; weights=nothing) -> Vector

Collapse per-sample flux contributions into a spectral density vector.

`fluxes` is a `(n_freq, n_samples)` matrix (column-major friendly). When `weights`
is `nothing`, samples are averaged uniformly: `mean_flux = sum(fluxes; dims=2) / n_samples`.
When `weights` is supplied, the contraction is `fluxes * weights / n_samples`
(no normalization of `weights`). The `0.4 = 2/5` prefactor captures the
sky/polarization average.
