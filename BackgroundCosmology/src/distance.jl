    distance_and_volume_grid(c::AbstractCosmology, z)
        -> (; comoving_distance, luminosity_distance, differential_comoving_volume)

Tabulate the three distance quantities on `z` in a single pass, sharing one
`1/E(z)` evaluation and one cumulative trapezoid between them.

`differential_comoving_volume` is the solid-angle-integrated `4π · dV_c/dz` in
Mpc³ per unit redshift — the `4π` lives here, not in the redshift-distribution
consumers, matching the Python `astrogwb` stack.

This is the efficient batched path for models that already evaluate and normalize
quantities on a redshift grid. Scalar distance calls use adaptive QuadGK integration
instead. The grid approximation and subsequent interpolation policy belong to the
caller.

Takes the grid **array**, not `(z_min, z_max, n)`, so the caller's grid is the grid used
— there is no way for tabulation and interpolation to disagree about nodes. The grid
must contain at least two strictly increasing nodes and start at zero, because the
cumulative comoving-distance integral assumes `d_c(0) = 0`.
