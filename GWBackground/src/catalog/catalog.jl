    SGWBCatalog{S<:NamedTuple}

Waveform catalog reduced for SGWB inference: the shared frequency axis, per-sample
per-frequency polarization power `|h₊|² + |h×|²`, and the per-sample source parameters
that produced it.

As loaded, `polarization_power` is referenced to the **electromagnetic** luminosity distance, i.e.
before the fiducial `(D_L/D_gw)²` scaling. Callers re-reference it to the fiducial GW
distance with [`apply_gw_distance_correction!`](@ref) before preparing an importance
model; after an in-place call the field is no longer EM-referenced, and because the
correction is not idempotent a second call on the same object squares the factor. Use
the out-of-place [`apply_gw_distance_correction`](@ref) where a cell or block may re-run.

`samples` is a NamedTuple whose keys are the source-parameter column names (e.g.
`:mass_1_source`, `:redshift`, `:inclination`, ...). `polarization_power` has shape
`(nfreq, nsamples)` -- column-major friendly for the importance-sampling hot loop,
and the orientation HDF5.jl reads the on-disk `(nsamples, nfreq)` C-order
polarization datasets into without a transpose.

`frequencies` comes from the file rather than being derived from
`(duration, sampling_frequency)` scalars. Band selection is the caller's job:
slice `frequencies` and the rows of `polarization_power` before calling an inference model.
Built by [`load_catalog`](@ref) from a `waveform_catalog` v1 file.

    apply_gw_distance_correction!(catalog::SGWBCatalog, prop) -> catalog

Re-reference `catalog.polarization_power` in place to the fiducial GW luminosity distance, pairing
the polarization-power matrix with the catalog's own `redshift` column. This is the form to prefer at
call sites: it removes the one way the correction can go mechanically wrong, namely
pairing the polarization-power matrix with a redshift vector that has been subsetted or reordered.

Not idempotent — see [`BackgroundCosmology.apply_gw_distance_correction!`](@ref).

"""
    average_mode(catalog::SGWBCatalog) -> AbstractAverageMode

Derive the inclination-averaging convention from the catalog's own `inclination`
column: an all-zero column means the waveforms were generated face-on and the
`2/5` inclination average must still be applied analytically
([`AnalyticInclination`](@ref)); any non-zero entry means the Monte Carlo average
over catalog samples already performs it ([`CatalogInclination`](@ref)).

Catalogs with no `inclination` column fall back to [`AnalyticInclination`](@ref),
matching the convention of the legacy face-on generator. Every `gwmock-pop`
catalog does emit the column, so that fallback only applies to hand-built
fixtures and pre-`gwmock` files.

Pass `average_mode` explicitly to [`spectral_density`](@ref),
`GWBackgroundInference.forward_model`, and
`GWBackgroundInference.gwbackground_importance_turing_model` to override the derived value.
