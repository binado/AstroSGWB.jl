    GWBackground

Astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background modeling: importance
sampling, redshift grids, and spectral-density forward models. Turing model construction lives in the
`GWBackgroundInference` package (see the `GWBackgroundInference/` directory in the repository).

The primary inference artifact is a **`waveform_catalog` v1 HDF5 file**, read by
[`load_catalog`](@ref) into an [`SGWBCatalog`](@ref): per-sample source parameters,
the shared frequency axis and in-band mask, and a `(nfreq, nsamples)` per-sample
polarization-power matrix `|h_+|² + |h_×|²` reduced from the stored complex polarizations.
Format IO lives in `PlusCross.jl`, so the same file is consumed unchanged by the
Python `astrogwb` package.

As loaded the polarization-power matrix is referenced to the **electromagnetic** luminosity distance
(before the fiducial `(D_L/D_gw)²` factor). Call
[`apply_gw_distance_correction!`](@ref) at the fiducial propagation before preparing an
importance model; the log-weights carry the compensating `+2 log Ξ_fid` term
unconditionally, so skipping the call under a non-GR fiducial biases the fit by `Ξ_fid²`.
The correction is **not idempotent**: an in-place call mutates the catalog it is given,
so reactive/Pluto call sites should use the out-of-place
[`apply_gw_distance_correction`](@ref).

The catalog also carries the inclination-averaging convention: [`average_mode`](@ref)
derives it from the `inclination` column, and it must be threaded to
[`spectral_density`](@ref) and to Turing model construction.

Callers define an importance adapter (or use one from `GWBackgroundImportanceModels`),
fiducial hyperparameters, and a catalog sample adapter in Julia, then pass raw catalog
`polarization_power`, restructured `samples`, and fiducials explicitly. Prepared importance models
cache proposal log-probabilities, redshift interpolants, and rate metadata; detector
store proposal log-probabilities, catalog redshifts, and the integration grid; detector
state (banded `frequencies`, network [`effective_psd`](@ref), observation time) is passed
to inference entry points as flattened arrays.
Inference state is a flat hyperparameter `NamedTuple`. The caller-owned model contract and
Turing integration live in `GWBackgroundInference`; this package provides the reusable physics
and array kernels used to implement that contract.
