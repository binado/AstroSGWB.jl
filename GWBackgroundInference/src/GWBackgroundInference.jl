    GWBackgroundInference

Turing/AdvancedHMC wrappers, the spectral-density forward model, and sampling helpers for
astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background inference.

# The model contract

Everything model-specific reaches this package through **one documented callable**:

    merger_rate_and_log_weights_fn(Λ, samples) -> (rate, log_weights)

- `Λ` is a flat `NamedTuple` of live hyperparameters.
- `samples` is the caller's per-event proposal sample collection.
- `rate` is the detector-frame merger rate in events per second.
- `log_weights` is one log importance weight per catalog sample.

There is no abstract type to subtype and no generic function to add methods to. A prepared
model is a **functor** -- a struct carrying its caches with a `(m::M)(Λ, samples)` method,
which keeps full dispatch and type parameters -- and an ad-hoc model is a plain closure:

    merger_rate_and_log_weights_fn = (Λ, samples) -> (1e-7 * Λ.rate_scale,
                                                      fill(Λ.weight_shift, length(samples.redshift)))

Hyperparameter *names* are declared by a caller-owned prior `@model` (`prior_model`), not
by the SGWB likelihood model: its `~` sites determine the full hyperparameter set and the
Turing variable creation order. The prior model is embedded with
`to_submodel(prior_model, false)`. Fixing a hyperparameter is Turing conditioning —
`model | (; R₀ = fiducials.R₀)` — so the chain carries exactly the sampled variables by
construction. A name the callable needs but `prior_model` omits surfaces as a `KeyError`
on `Λ.name` at the first evaluation, before the sampler burns wall clock.

[`forward_model`](@ref) is the single implementation of the forward pass, shared by the
`@model` body ([`gwbackground_importance_turing_model`](@ref)) and the caller-side synthesis
of `observed` at the fiducial point. Scoring a point is `Turing.logjoint(model, θ)`;
there is deliberately no second likelihood implementation to drift from the first.

# Two likelihoods

[`gwbackground_amplitude_marginalized_turing_model`](@ref) integrates one strictly
multiplicative hyperparameter out of the Gaussian likelihood instead of sampling it,
removing the amplitude--shape degeneracy NUTS handles worst. It publishes the amplitude
sufficient statistics, and [`reconstruct_amplitude`](@ref) turns them back into draws of
the physical parameter in post-processing. See `amplitude.jl` for the math.

# Writing chains

[`NETCDF_PARAMETER_NAMES`](@ref) maps the Unicode hyperparameter names used everywhere in
Julia code, config, and tests onto ASCII names **on netCDF write only**, so the files this
package produces carry the same variable names as the Python `astrogwb` stack's. Applying
it is [`rename_posterior_for_netcdf`](@ref), which — together with
[`merge_into_posterior`](@ref) — lives in a package extension and requires
`FlexiChains` to be loaded. Callers then `convert_to_inference_data` + `to_netcdf`.

    rename_posterior_for_netcdf(chain::FlexiChain) -> FlexiChain

Rename parameters through [`NETCDF_PARAMETER_NAMES`](@ref), immediately before
`InferenceObjects.convert_to_inference_data` + `to_netcdf`.

Unicode hyperparameter names (`Ωm`, `Ξ₀`, `γ`, …) stay put in Julia code, config TOML, and
tests, where they are the physics notation the rest of the repo reads in; only the written
file gets ASCII names, which is what makes a Julia netCDF and a Python `astrogwb` netCDF
diffable variable-for-variable. The live chain used for plots is left alone — rename a
copy at the file boundary.

Requires `FlexiChains` to be loaded (this method lives in a package extension).

    merge_into_posterior(chain::FlexiChain, nt::NamedTuple) -> FlexiChain

Add the variables in `nt` to `chain`, requiring each value to match `size(chain)` so the

[`reconstruct_amplitude`](@ref)'s outputs into the chain before renaming and writing.
