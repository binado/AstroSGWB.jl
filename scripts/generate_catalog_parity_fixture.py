"""Generate the cross-language catalog parity fixture for Julia tests.

Writes a small ``waveform_catalog`` v1 file together with the polarization power
that the Python ``astrogwb`` package derives from it. The Julia test in
``GWBackground/test/test_io.jl`` loads the same ``.h5`` with ``load_catalog`` and
asserts its ``polarization_power`` array matches the ``.npz`` reference -- i.e.
that both languages reduce one catalog file to the same numbers.

This imports ``astrogwb`` deliberately: inlining the reduction here would only
test this script against itself. Run it with the ``astrogwb`` checkout's
interpreter, from the GWBackground.jl repo root::

    ../astrogwb/.venv/bin/python3 scripts/generate_catalog_parity_fixture.py

Writes (both are gitignored, and the Julia test skips when they are absent):

- ``GWBackground/test/fixtures/catalog_parity_reference.h5`` -- the catalog itself.
- ``GWBackground/test/fixtures/catalog_parity_reference.npz`` -- arrays
  ``polarization_power`` (``(nfreq, nsamples)``) and ``frequencies``.
